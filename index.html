           <p>The first portable telephone came out in 1983 and was something that was new and easy to access for everyone. Instead of having the phone on the wall or in your 
               car and being limited to a certain spot, they came up with the idea of being able to communicate without the need to just be at home or in your car. The first 
               portable telephone came in the shape of the Motorola KynaTAC 8000X. It weighed just under a kilogram, stood 33cm high, stored 30 numbers, took 10 hours to charge,
                and offered 30 minutes of talk time. It cost about $4,000, which would be about $10,000 in today’s currency, and it was a sign of important significance because of 
                the time and price. The next phone upgrade was the Motorola Microtac 9800X was considered as the first portable phone because it was lighter in weight and could actually 
                fit in people’s pockets. It was released in 1989 and could show more information and wasn’t as chunky as its predecessors. It costs between $2,495 and $3,495. The next upgrade 
                came out in 1992 and was called the Motorola International 3200 and Nokia 1011. They were both small in size from their predecessors and had more space to hold more numbers and 
                a longer call time. These are all of the phones that were simple in design and were used to make calls long distances before any type of game features were invented. This was just
                the beginning.

                Phones were still being upgraded in their size and weight. People wanted a small phone that could fit inside of their pockets and hands comfortably. The Motorola Startac was the 
                first clamshell cellular phone and one of the first to have a display screen in 1996. It was the first flip phone and cost $1,000. The Nokia 8110 was also released in 1996 and had
                 4GB of storage, faster service, and a better protection policy. It was the first Nokia high-end 8000 series of phones. It had a sliding cover that protected the keypad and was the 
                 first Nokia phone with monochrome graphic LCD. It was featured in the Matrix movie and became a big hit. Then the Siemens S10 that came out in 1997 brought the mobile phone display 
                 with four different colors. It was the first phone that had the option of adding color to the screen. You could send and receive emails and the phone would also vibrate to alert you 
                 of a message. Hagenuk launched the GlobalHandy that was the first phone that didn’t have an external aerial. New themes with different color options were also starting to appear on
                  the market for customers. There were swappable keyboards that you could switch to with a different color. Nokia also launched a range of interchangeable covers in the following year 
                  for the 5100 series of phones. This made it the first time that cell phones could also be fashion orientated. This became very popular with the general public.
